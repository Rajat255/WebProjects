                <strong>Ukraine's Reel To Real Life Hero</strong><br><br>
                Born 25 January 1978 Volodymyr Zelensky is a Ukrainian statesman and the Ukranian President, former actor and comedian who has been serving as the president of Ukraine since 2019. He gained worldwide recognition as the wartime leader of Ukraine during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Before getting into polictics he was a Comedian and started this journey in the early age of 17.<br><br>
                
                Zelenskyy attended school in Kryvyy Rih. He later attended Kryvyi Rih Institute of Economics, then a department of Kyiv National Economic University and now part of Kryvyi Rih National University. He earned a law degree from here, however, he never worked in the legal field.<br><br>

                Zelenskyy instead went into the entertainment field, becoming a comedian. He spent many years with the Kvartal 95, comedy troupe. He also starred in several TV shows and feature films.<br><br>

                However, his most famous role was in 'Servant of the People,' a TV show which aired between 2015 and 2019. In the show, Zelenskyy played a high-school history teacher in his 30s who won the presidential election after a viral video showed him ranting against the Ukrainian government. The show tackled corruption within the Ukrainian government and became a huge hit among the people of the country.<br><br>

                The year the show ended, Zelenskyy announced his candidature for the presidential position. 
                Zelensky's ascend in politics came aside a tumultuous period in the history of Ukraine. In 2014, Russia seized Crimea and supported the separatist movement in East Ukraine. The same year, the then-president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted from office following massive protests. Petro Poroshenko became the President of fragile Ukraine in 2014.<br><br>

                It was the 'anti-corruption' sentiment among the population that paved for Zelenskyy, who portrayed himself as an anti-corruption leader in 'Servant of the People', to eventually become the leader of the country.<br><br>

                In 2019, he contested the election for the post of President and decisively defeated incumbent Poroshenko. Zelenskyy's victory was a landslide as he gained 73.2% of the votes. On May 20, 2019, he was sworn in as the sixth President of Ukraine.<br><br>
                 
                And now infront of him is the mammoth task of singlehandedly carrying the country in wartimes, waged by a gigantic nation and to fight it alone without the help of sworn friends.
